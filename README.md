# Edge-Assisted Anomaly Detection for Smart Home IoT

This repository contains the experimental implementation used in the dissertation:

*“Edge-Assisted Anomaly Detection Framework for Securing Smart Home IoT Devices.”*

The experiments were implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and executed using Visual Studio Code.

## Dataset
The Edge-IIoTset dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size.
It is publicly available on Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedamineferrag/edgeiiotset-cyber-security-dataset-of-iot-iiot

From the dataset, the folder **“Selected dataset for ML and DNN”** was used.
All experiments in this repository are based exclusively on:

`ML-EdgeIIoT-dataset.csv`

## Contents
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Random Forest, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest models  
- Evaluation metrics and visualisations  
- Reproducible experimental results
