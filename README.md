# Edge-Assisted Anomaly Detection for Smart Home IoT

This repository contains the experimental implementation used in the dissertation:

*“Edge-Assisted Anomaly Detection Framework for Securing Smart Home IoT Devices.”*

The experiments are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and evaluate Random Forest, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest models using the Edge-IIoTset flow-based dataset.

## Repository Contents
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling steps  
- Model training and evaluation code  
- Generated figures (confusion matrices, ROC curves, F1-score comparison)  
- Summary result tables  

All results reported in the dissertation can be reproduced by executing the notebook.

This repository is provided **for academic verification and reference purposes only**.
